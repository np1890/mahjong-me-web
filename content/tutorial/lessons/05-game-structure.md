The full game is played over four rounds, each with at least four deals. Each round has its own rules.

**1. East Wind Round**

Gameplay begins with four rounds of East. Before play starts, the table decides which style to use. In **East "anything goes"**, any valid hand of four sets and a pair wins — the standard combinations you have learned. In **East passport**, specific passport hands are required to declare Mahjong.

**2. South Wind Round**

After four games of East, play moves to four rounds of South. This is the card round. Players use either **small cards** (each player gets a different hand from a card) or the **big card** (also known as GITA), where the dealer chooses one hand and all four players try to make it. There is a compulsory tile exchange at the start, and buying from the player to your left is allowed in this round.

**3. West Wind Round**

Play moves on to four rounds of West, also called the **Goulash** round. Only Pungs and Kongs are allowed — no Chows, Crochets, or Knits. There is a compulsory exchange at the start.

**4. North Wind Round**

The final four rounds are **Dealer's choice**. The dealer decides what to play: it can be card hands, Goulash, or a mix. Goulash in the North round may include **Goulash with jokers**, where Flowers act as jokers to help complete hands.
