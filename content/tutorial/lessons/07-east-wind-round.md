order: 7

The East Wind Round is the first round of the game. Before play begins, the table decides whether to use "anything goes" (any valid hand wins) or "passport" (specific hands required). The combinations below are options, not compulsory — tables may use different rules, so ask before starting.

**Setup and order of play**

1. Shuffle the tiles and build the walls.
2. Each player rolls the dice; the highest total becomes East (the dealer).
3. East rolls again to break the wall. The deal begins from the left of the break.
4. Tiles are dealt until each player has 13 (East has 14). Always count your tiles before play starts.
5. Replace any Flowers or Seasons with a draw from the flower wall. East exchanges first, then South, West, North.
6. East makes the first discard.

| Aspect | Rules |
|--------|-------|
| **Exchanges** | None at start. Flowers and Seasons are replaced immediately after the deal (draw from the flower wall). East exchanges first, then South, West, North. |
| **Racking** | Place the tile you draw on your rack before discarding. Until you do, the previous player's discard stays in play and can still be claimed. Beginners often arrange discards in rows of four to make them easier to follow. |
| **Permitted sets** | **Standard:** 4 sets of 3 + 1 pair (14 tiles). Sets can be Pung, Kong, Chow (clean or mixed), Crochet. You may end with a Knit *only* if your hand already contains a Crochet. Pung or Pair of Honours can be part of any set. Any pair is valid to complete the hand. You may have two valid combinations in one hand. |
| **Passport options** | If your table plays passport, these are some valid alternatives: (1) 3 pairs in 3 different suits + 2 sets + 1 pair; (2) 3 pairs in the same suit + 2 sets + 1 pair; (3) 3 knits (in 2 suits) + 2 sets + 1 pair — 4th knit in different suits only if you have a Crochet; (4) 3 pure or mixed runs + 1 set + 1 pair; (5) NEWS (4 winds + wind pair) + 3 sets; (6) GRW (3 dragons + dragon/wind pair) + 3 sets. |
| **Claiming** | Clean chow: from the player on your left only. Pung: from anyone. Kong: from anyone. Mahjong: from anyone. Buying is not allowed. |
| **Declaring Mahjong** | When your hand is complete, say "Mahjong!" and lay your tiles face-up. Always check the hand before scoring. Do not expose your hand until it has been correctly claimed. If a player declares Mahjong incorrectly, they are the defaulter and become a "dead hand"; play continues with that player drawing and discarding on their turn. |
| **Flowers / Seasons** | Replace immediately with a draw from the flower wall. Own flower pair: 500 from all. Round flower pair: 500 from all. Real Bouquet (own + round flower pair): 1000 from all (even on a draw). |
| **Scoring** | Use scoring sticks (100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000). Exposed hand = Half limit (500 from non-dealers, 1000 from dealer). Concealed hand = Full limit (1000 from non-dealers, 2000 from dealer). East always pays and receives double. |
