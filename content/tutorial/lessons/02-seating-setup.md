Before play begins, the table must be set up and the first dealer chosen. This happens at the start of every game.

**1. Build the walls and determine East**

Shuffle all tiles face down and place them on the table. Each player builds a wall in front of them: 18 columns of 2 tiles stacked high (36 tiles per wall). The four walls form a square. Then each player rolls both dice. The highest total becomes East (the dealer). If two or more players tie for the highest roll, only those players roll again until one has the highest number.

**2. Assign wind positions**

Once East is set, the other positions go counter-clockwise in the order East, South, West, North. A simple way to remember this is: "Eat Soup With Noodles."

**3. Break the wall and establish the flower wall**

East rolls the dice again. Count that number counter-clockwise around the table, starting with East. The player you land on breaks their wall. That player counts that many stacks (pairs of tiles) from the right edge of their wall and separates them. The tiles to the right of the break form the flower wall (used for flower replacement and Kong draws). The deal begins from the left of the break.

In this example, the dealer (East) rolls a 4. The count starts with East - 1, South - 2, West - 3 and North - 4. North then counts 4 stacks from the right of their wall and places the 2 tiles from the last stack on top of the tiles to the right (i.e. breaks the wall) to mark the flower wall. Dealing then begins from the left of the wall break.

**4. Deal the tiles**

Tiles are dealt from the wall to the left of the break, in order from right to left (clockwise along the wall). Each player takes tiles in turn, going counter-clockwise around the table. The deal goes in three rounds of four tiles each (12 tiles per player), then one tile to each player (13 each). East receives one extra tile for a total of 14. East always starts the game with the first discard.

**5. When the deal moves**

After each hand, the dealer moves one position to the right (counter-clockwise) so the next player becomes East. A full round is complete once each player has been dealer.

Some tables choose to play with house rules where there are exceptions in certain cases, but these are agreed before gameplay begins: if the dealer wins the hand, the dealer keeps the deal; if it is a wall game (nobody wins), the dealer keeps the deal; and in some groups, if the game is a tie, the dealer may keep the deal (table rule).

**6. Exchanges before play**

In all rounds, flower tiles are exchanged as soon as they are received (unless they are in play as jokers). This means that once dealing is complete, flower tiles are exchanged with a tile from the flower wall. East (the dealer) exchanges their flowers first, followed by South, West and North. In some rounds (South, West, and optionally North), there are mandatory or optional tile exchanges before East makes the first discard. Those are explained in the round-specific lessons.
