**Scoring sticks**

Players use scoring sticks (or chips) to track points: 100, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000. Sticks are exchanged between players after each hand based on the score.

**East always gives and gets double**

In every round, the dealer (East) pays and receives double. If you owe 500 to the winner, East owes 1000. If the winner pays you 500, East pays you 1000. If East wins, each player pays them double.

**East Wind Round scoring**

Hands are paid by limit. An **exposed hand** (one or more sets built from discards) pays **half limit**: 500 from non-dealers, 1000 from the dealer. A **concealed hand** (all tiles self-picked) pays **full limit**: 1000 from non-dealers, 2000 from the dealer. Flower bonuses apply: own flower pair 500 from all, round flower pair 500 from all, Real Bouquet (own + round) 1000 from all (even on a draw).

**South Wind Round scoring**

Payment depends on the card. **Half limit** = 500, **full limit** = 1000, **double limit** = 2000, **super limit** = 4000, **top limit** = 10000. Each card specifies which limit applies. East gives and receives double. Flower bonuses are the same as in the East round.

**Goulash (West Wind Round) scoring**

The basic score comes from your pungs and kongs (exposed vs concealed, major vs minor tiles), plus 20 for going Mahjong. Doubling conditions (e.g. all honours, one suit, concealed hand) multiply the score. Players often set a cap (e.g. 5000/10000). Clean hands with three doubles also receive payment. Each player contributes to a Kitty (e.g. 500) at the start; on a draw, more is added and East keeps the deal.

**North Wind Round scoring**

Card hands without jokers are typically paid at 2000/4000 or 4000/8000 (from non-dealers / from dealer). Card hands with jokers are paid at half (table rule). East gives and receives double. Double Limit cards are often reserved for North, with Flowers as jokers.

**Etiquette**

Do not expose your hand until it has been correctly claimed. In the case of a wrong call, the player is deemed a "dead hand" and play continues; the dead hand draws and discards on their turn. Table rules vary — ask before play begins.
