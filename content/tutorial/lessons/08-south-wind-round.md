description: "Card round: Small Cards or GITA, compulsory exchange, claiming, buying, scoring."
order: 8

The South Wind Round is the card round. After four deals of East, play moves to South. The original East rolls the dice, cuts the wall, and deals the tiles. Once Flowers are replaced, there is a compulsory tile exchange before play begins. The table chooses between two styles: **Small Cards** or **Mahjong GITA** (Big Card).

**Small Cards vs Mahjong GITA**

- **Small Cards:** East places the cards face down. Each player picks one card in turn. Every player has a *different* hand to make — these are Special Classical Hands. Repeats are allowed unless the card says otherwise. Payment depends on the card (half, full, double, super, or top limit).
- **Mahjong GITA (Big Card):** East chooses *one* hand from a list. All four players try to make *the same* hand. This is intermediate/advanced. All hands are paid Limit 1000/2000.
- Double Limit cards are usually reserved for the North Wind Round (with Flowers as jokers).

**Exchanges (before East's first discard)**

Replace any Flowers or Seasons with a draw from the flower wall. East exchanges first, then South, West, North.

**Compulsory exchange:** Pass 3 tiles in turn: East to right, then left, then across. For each exchange, the remaining pair of players also exchange tiles.

East decides: 1 or 3 tic-tac/dotting (Charleston).

East decides: 1 or 3 exchanges with the wall. Wall exchanges cannot be drawn from the Garden (flower) wall, the Playing wall, and your Own wall.

Game starts with East's first discard. Rack your tile upon picking; the previous discard stays in play until the next player racks.

| Aspect | Rules |
|--------|-------|
| **Exchanges** | Compulsory: 3 tiles (East→right, left, across), then 1 or 3 tic-tac/dotting, then 1 or 3 wall exchanges. Wall exchanges cannot be picked from Garden, Playing, and Own wall. East chooses how many tic-tacs/wall exchanges. |
| **Small Cards – hands** | Each player picks a different card. Follow the title, explanation, and last line on your card. The last line says how you may take tiles (see below). Repeats allowed unless the card says otherwise. *Tip:* Red Bamboos = 1, 5, 7, 9; Green Bamboos = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. |
| **Mahjong GITA – hands** | East chooses one hand; all four players make it. Many complex hands (4 Kongs, Twin Kongs, Royal Konging, Terminal Chows, Qwongs, etc.). Extra tile for each Kong in 2-, 3-, and 4-Kong hands. |
| **Card last-line rules** | **Concealed hand:** All tiles self-picked or bought; last tile to Mahjong self-picked or bought from left. **Exposed hand:** You took a tile from the table (pung, clean chow from left, or Mahjong). **All tiles from wall:** No table calling; buy from left only; Mahjong tile from left or self-pick. **Last tile from discard:** Can take from table for pung/kong/Mahjong; can buy from left; can self-pick. |
| **Claiming** | Table calling permitted – Pung or Kong from anyone; clean chow from left; Mahjong from discard unless your card says otherwise. |
| **Buying** | Allowed from the left's discard only (South Wind Round only). Bought tile stays concealed. Any other concealed tiles on your rack must be exposed immediately. |
| **Racking** | Place the picked tile on your rack before discarding. Until you do, the previous discard stays in play and can be claimed. Racking helps prevent late calls. |
| **Flowers / Seasons** | Same bonuses: Own flower pair 500, Round flower pair 500, Real Bouquet 1000 (even on a draw). |
| **Scoring** | Per card: Half limit (500), Full limit (1000), Double limit (2000), Super limit (4000), Top limit (10000). East gives and receives double. Double Limit cards reserved for North. |
