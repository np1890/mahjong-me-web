The North Wind Round is East's choice. The dealer decides what to play: any of the hands from earlier rounds, Goulash, Card hands (including double limit), Goulash with Jokers, or something improvised. Buying is not allowed. Pung from anywhere; clean chow/run from the left; Mahjong from discard unless the card denies it.

**Goulash with Jokers:** The dealer declares any minor number as jokers for the game. Only a crochet of jokers can be used by each player.
