A winning hand is made of 14 tiles = 4 sets (of 3 tiles each) and a pair. Here are the basic combinations you need to know.

**Sets of three**

A **Pung** is three identical tiles (for example, three 5 Bamboos).

A **Chow** (or run) is a sequence of three tiles of the same suit in numerical order (for example, 2-3-4 of Dots).

A **Mixed Chow** is a run of three tiles in numerical sequence, with each tile from a different suit (for example, 2 Dots, 3 Bamboos, 4 Characters).

A **Crochet** is three tiles with the same number, one from each suit (for example, 5 Dots, 5 Bamboos, 5 Characters).

**Sets of four**

A **Kong** is four identical tiles (for example, four 8 Characters). When you declare a Kong (whether self-picked or claimed), you immediately draw one extra tile from the flower wall before discarding.

**Sets of two (pairs)**

A **Clean Pair** is two identical tiles (for example, two East Winds).

A **Knit** is two tiles with the same number in two different suits (for example, 7 Dots and 7 Bamboos). A Knit can only complete a winning hand if your hand already contains a Crochet.

**Sets of five (Qwongs)**

A **Qwong** is five identical tiles. It is made using up to four real tiles plus one or more jokers (as defined by the round). For example, five 3 Bamboos could be made with three 3 Bamboos plus two Flowers as jokers. Qwongs are used only in certain hands and are covered in the round-specific lessons.

**Concealed vs exposed, and self-picked vs claimed**

A set is **concealed** if every tile in it was self-picked from the wall.

A set is **exposed** if you used a tile from another player's discard to complete it. You must lay that set face-up on the table when you claim it.

**Self-picked** means you drew the completing tile from the wall. **Claimed** or **Called** means you took the completing tile from someone's discard. **Buying** means you took a discarded tile from the player to your left. Self-picked sets stay concealed; claimed or bought sets are exposed. Concealed hands generally score higher than exposed hands.
