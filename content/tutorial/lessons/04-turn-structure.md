**The goal**

The objective is to build a complete hand before anyone else. A complete hand has 14 tiles: four sets of three tiles each and one pair. As soon as you have that, you can declare Mahjong.

**Declaring Mahjong**

When your hand is complete, say "Mahjong!" and lay all your tiles face-up on the table. Play stops immediately and the hand is checked and scored. Do not expose your hand until the mahjong hand has been checked. In the case of a wrong call, the player is deemed a "dead hand" and play continues. The dead hand player draws and discards the drawn tile on their turn.

**Wall game (nobody wins)**

If the wall runs out and no one has declared Mahjong, the hand is a draw. This is called a wall game. Players reshuffle, build new walls, and play a Goulash hand (described in the West Wind Round lesson).

**Taking turns**

Play moves counter-clockwise. On your turn, you draw one tile from the wall, add it to your hand, evaluate your sets and discard one tile face-up into the centre. You must call the tile you discard out loud, and the next player then takes their turn.

**Claiming rules**

You can only claim a discarded tile when it completes a set in your hand. Who you can claim from depends on what you are making:

- **Chow** (a run): You may only take a discard from the player to your left.
- **Pung** and **Kong**: You may take a discard from any player, at any time provided you call the tile first and the next player has not racked their tile yet.
- **Mahjong** (winning): You may take a discard from any player, at any time.

When you claim a tile, you must expose the completed set face-up on the table (unless you are going Mahjong with a fully concealed hand).

**Racking**

Place each tile you draw on your rack before discarding. Until you do, the previous player's discard is still "in play" — another player can still claim it. Racking gives everyone a moment to decide whether to claim, and helps avoid disputes over late calls. This is a common table practice rather than a formal rule.

**Conflicting claims**

Sometimes two or more players want the same discarded tile. Priority rules decide who gets it. A claim to win (Mahjong) outranks a claim to make a Pung or Kong. A claim to make a Pung or Kong outranks a claim to make a Chow. If two players both want the tile to win, the player whose turn would normally come first (in counter-clockwise order) gets the tile. For example, if the discarder is East and both South and West want it to win, South gets it, because South's turn comes before West's.
