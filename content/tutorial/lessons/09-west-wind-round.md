title: "West Wind Round"
description: "Goulash round: Pungs and Kongs only, honours, majors, doubles, Kitty."
order: 9
---

The West Wind Round is the Goulash round. Goulash is played for every hand in this round, and also after a wall game (when nobody wins). No Jokers, no buying, no Runs (Chows), no Crochet, no Knit — only Pungs and Kongs ending in a Pair. Each hand must have a minimum of 3 doubles to count.

**Honours and majors**

- **Honours** = Red, Green, White Dragons + East, South, West, North Winds.
- **Majors** = Honours + Terminals (1s and 9s of any suit).
- **Minors** = Numbers 2–8.

**Examples of valid hands (3 doubles covered):** 4 Pungs/Kongs + Pair of Honours only; One suit without Honours; One suit with Honours (1 double + 2 more doubles needed).

**The Kitty**

When a Goulash hand is played after a draw, each player places 500 points in the Kitty. East collects it. If the hand is another draw, a further 1000 is added, and so on (table rule). The outright winner claims the Kitty.

**Exchanges (compulsory)**

Begin by exchanging Flower tiles with a draw from the flower wall. Since Flower tiles can count towards your doubles, they are placed face-down on the rack and are not revealed to other players.

Then: same order as South — 3 tiles to each wind (East→right, left, across; South→East, West, North; West→North, South, East; North→West, East, South). East then decides 1 or 3 tic-tac/dotting, then 1 or 3 wall exchanges. Wall exchanges cannot be drawn from the Garden, Playing, or Own wall. All tiles taken from the wall are replaced by your discards.

| **Clean hands** | A clean hand covering 3 doubles also gets paid (a count). If penalty is paid (e.g. giving a tile to Mahjong when not calling), other players do not get a count. |
| **Basic rules** | Flowers concealed until player is on penalty. May not end an Honour hand with a Terminal pair (or vice versa). Check the Mahjong hand before exposing your own. Dead hand: if you give a tile to Mahjong when not calling, you pay penalty. |
