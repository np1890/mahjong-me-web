## 1. The three suits (108 tiles)

The numbered tiles are split into three suits: **Rings** (also called Circles or Dots), **Bamboos** (Bams or Boos), and **Characters** (Cracks or Craks). Each suit has tiles numbered 1 through 9, with four copies of each number. That gives 36 tiles per suit and 108 in total.

**Rings** (also called Circles or Dots)

**Bamboos** (Bams or Boos)

**Characters** (Cracks or Craks)

**Terminals and minors:** Tiles 1 and 9 in each suit are called **terminals**. Tiles 2 through 8 are called **minors**. This distinction matters for scoring and for certain special hands.

**Majors:** The term **majors** combines terminals (1s and 9s) with honour tiles (Winds and Dragons). Majors are used in several special hands, such as All Pair Major Hand.

*All majors: one of each Wind, one of each Dragon, and 1s and 9s of each suit*

**Bamboo nuances:** Bamboos have two details worth remembering. First, colour coding: **Red Bamboos** are 1, 5, 7, and 9; **Green Bamboos** are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Second, the 1 Bamboo tile is usually shown as a bird (often a crane) instead of a single bamboo stalk.

## 2. Honour tiles (28 tiles)

There are two kinds of honour tiles, Dragons and Winds. Each type has four tiles.

**Dragons** come in three types: Red, Green, and White.

**Dragons:**

**Winds** come in four: East, South, West, and North. Honour tiles play an important role in scoring, particularly in West round (Goulash).

**Winds:**

**Corresponding dragons (CD):** In some rounds, each dragon is linked to a suit. White Dragon corresponds to Rings, Green Dragon to Bamboos, and Red Dragon to Characters. You will use this when building certain hands in the South and North Wind rounds.

## 3. Bonus tiles (8 tiles)

There are four **Flower** tiles (Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, and Bamboo) and four **Season** tiles (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter). Each has a number 1–4 that matches a wind: 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West, 4 = North. Bonus tiles are replaced with a draw from the flower wall when you receive them, and they can earn extra points. In Goulash (West Wind) rounds, they also give higher scoring opportunities.

**Flowers (1–4):**

**Seasons (1–4):**

## 4. Additional materials

You will need two dice for choosing the dealer and breaking the wall, racks to hold your tiles, and scoring sticks (typically 100, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000) to track points between players.
